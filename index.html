  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Birthday</button>
  <div class="content">
      <p>I was born in Chicago, Illinois  - May 12, 2002 on Mother's day</p>
    </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Music</button>
<div class="content">
  <img src="images/TheStrokes.jpg" alt="The Strokes, Band" width="250" height="100">
    <p>I listen to all kinds of music, but lately, I’ve been really into Alternative. 
      There's something about the energy and emotion in the genre that draws me in. 
      Right now, I’m into All These Things That I've Done by The Killers, and Ode to the Mets 
      by The Strokes has a sound that sticks with me—it's nostalgic and fresh at the same time. 
      Double Negative by Dominic Fike has also been a favorite, with a laid-back vibe that's 
      easy to relax to. Lately, Alternative just fits my mood, though I'm always up for finding 
      new music.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Food</button>
<div class="content">
  <img src="images/Mangu.jpg" alt="Mangu" width="250" height="100">
    <p>Food has always been a huge part of my life—it’s not just about eating, 
      but about the experience and joy that comes with it. I especially love the 
      flavors from my culture in the Dominican Republic, like Mangu, Arroz con Habichuela,
       Arroz con Guandules, Tostones, and Jibaritos. These dishes are comforting and full of tradition. 
       But being a Chicago native, I’ve also developed a love for Italian beefs and Chicago-style hotdogs. 
      Food for me is a way to connect with my roots, experience new flavors, and share moments with others.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Favorite Super-Hero</button>
  <div class="content">
    <img src="images/Spiderman.jpg" alt="Spiderman" width="250" height="100">
    <p>I love Spider-Man because he feels so real. He’s not just a superhero—he’s someone 
      who struggles with everyday stuff like school, work, and relationships, all while 
      trying to do the right thing. What makes him stand out is that he doesn’t have it all 
      figured out, and yet he still manages to fight for what’s important. His determination 
      to keep going, even when life gets tough, is something I really connect with.
       It’s like a reminder that you don’t need to be perfect to make a difference.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Favorite Show</button>
  <div class="content">
  <img src="images/HighFidelity.jpg" alt="High Fidelity" width="250" height="100">
    <p>My favorite shows are a mix of different vibes, but they all hold a special place. 
      High Fidelity is one I can always go back to—its blend of music, relationships, and 
      personal growth really speaks to me, and I love the way the main character navigates 
      through life and love. Avatar: The Last Airbender is another one that never gets old. 
      The world-building, incredible characters, and the depth of the story always keep me hooked.
       Then there's The OC, with its mix of drama and humor; it captures the ups and downs of growing 
       up in a way that's both relatable and engaging. Lastly, New Girl is my go-to for a good laugh. 
       The quirky characters and feel-good moments are just the perfect escape. Each of these shows 
       brings something different, but they all have that way of sticking with me.</p>
